# Project Title

Social Media a where users share one song of their choice per day.

## Description

TuneLink is an innovative web application developed using Django, designed to provide seamless connectivity and functionality. This Django app is connected with a PostgreSQL database to securely store and manage models created by Django, including Users, Profiles, and Posts. It leverages the Spotify Developer API to fetch accurate song and artist data whenever a user makes a post. It also uses JavaScript to create asynchronous functions that send data to the backend without requiring a full page refresh. To see all technologies used see more in the Built With section.

TunkLink is hosted on a cloud web hosting service called Render. Please note I am using the free version of their web instance and database so things may take a little while to load.
